## Going to Promenade

1. LF - Slow
2. RF - Slow
3. LF **+ rotation to the left** - Quick
4. RF to PP *(with rotation to the right to get back in line)*.

The rotation give the explosivity. This can also be applied in 4-steps and 5-steps.

Pay attention to not turn the lady with the arm but with the rotation.  
Pay attention to not rise the right shoulder.  
Pay attention to have arms horizontal and not tilted to the front.

**PP is just opening the hips, not the chest.**
