# Rise and Fall timing

- 1 Start low
- 1& Start Rising
- 2- Continue Rising
- 3 Continue Rising
- 3& Start going down *and prepare next step*. **DO NOT DROP**

From 1& to 2 to 3 the Rise should be progressive.  
Extension should be at maximum on 3.  
Use knees and ankles.

# Rise and Fall Feeling

Feel that the core is moving rather than the legs.  
Core should not stop moving, **like a ball moving and rolling and swinging**.
The feeling is more important than the timing.
If you follow too much the timing you will look like a robot and your dance will look like hashed.

# General remarks

- Think about when you can place a CBM.
- If you don't go lower to prepare your step, this implies that you might go for a chasse.
- Do not lose connection at the hips.
- Lead with the hips rather than with the arms.
- In the chasse, don't bring the partner closer to you, __let her have space__.

# Exercise

Start in position, step to the side and close with a balancing movement.  
Keep elbows up. Keep the feet parallel and the knees above them.
Close the legs faster and rise the foot up.  
Do not rise to the extend of the leg. Keep the knee bend.

# Start

1. From start position, side step to the left (LF first) on beats 1 2 3.
2. Side step to the right on beats 1 2.
3. Step Left Foot forward on beat 3 to get into... natural turn ?
