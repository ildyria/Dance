# Rise and Fall timing

- 1 Start low
- 1& Start Rising
- 2- Continue Rising
- 3 Continue Rising
- 3& Start going down *and prepare next step*. **DO NOT DROP**

From 1& to 2 to 3 the Rise should be progressive.  
Extension should be at maximum on 3.  
Use knees and ankles.

# Rise and Fall Feeling

Feel that the core is moving rather than the legs.  
Core should not stop moving, **like a ball balancing**.

# Exercice.

Start in position, step to the side and close with a balancing movement.  
Keep elbows up. Keep the feet parallel and the knees above them.
Close the legs faster and rise the foot up.  
Do not rise to the extend of the leg. Keep the knee bend.
