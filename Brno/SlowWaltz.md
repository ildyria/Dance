# Whisk  

Arms should still be horizontal.  
Use the obliques to maintain the hips horizontal, NOT TWISTED.  

# Same foot lounge to the right  

Extension from both legs.  
Picture what figure you want to achieve.  

# Second lounge to the left (followed by chasse to the right)  

Left heel is still on the floor on two. **This is not a full extension!**  
On 3 close with the right foot, and **continue to rise**.  
On 3.5 pivot and go down + Left foot forward.  

# Impetus  

1 - Step back LF  
2 - Heel turn  
3 - Promenade  

# Rotations  

## Exercise  

Take a chair, in front of a mirror.  
Sit, butt in the middle (not full back).  
Arms in position.  
Rotate upper part (if possible to 90 degree).  
Try to reach forward (while staying straight obviously).  
Help with the hand from the back the shoulder-blade.  
e.g. if turning to the right, left arm is forward. With the right hand, try to pull the shoulder-blade forward too.  
idem when turning to the left.  

## In position  

Imaging having a circle going from the back of the head, to the left hand,  
to the back of the head of the partner, to the right hand.  

## When turning right  

When turning right, rotation is usually on *1*  

Rotation is on (*x*)  

1 2 3 - Natural turn (*1*)  
1&2 3 - Running spin turn (*1, 2*)  
1 2 3 - Running finish  
1 2 3 - Natural turn (*1*)  
1 2 3 - Impetus  

When going forward, go forward, not around partner.  
At the same time do the rotation.  

Use a "soft knee" (i.e. going very slightly down before rising, a bit like a bus arriving at a stop) on 1.  

## When turning left  

1 2 3 - Reverse turn  
1 2&3 - Chasse to the right  
1&2 3 - Quick open Reverse  
1 2 ..... Corta (?)  

When turning left, rotation is usually and the *&* after the 1 (after a pendulum movement).  


Use a "soft knee" (i.e. going very slightly down before rising, a bit like a bus arriving at a stop) on 1.
