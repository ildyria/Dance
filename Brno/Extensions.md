# Energies

There are two forces:

- Gravity
- Resistance of the floor

You need to feel these two forces inside you.
The resistance goes from the front, and then to the back through the shoulder-blades.
It then goes into the arms (maintaining then horizontally).

# Going Up

When going up, the **shoulders are going down**.
When going back to medium, elbows should not fall. They stay in line with the shoulders.
Feel the Gravity pushing the shoulder down.

Pay attention to not have a hollow back!

# Going Down

When going down, we have an **extension of the head**.
As if someone was pulling from the hair.

# In Dance

Focus on one of two (either going up or going down).
However do not stay only up (e.g. in extension) as this makes the dance stiff.
