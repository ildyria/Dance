# Energies

There are two forces:

- Gravity
- Resistance of the floor

You need to feel these two forces inside you.
The resistance goes from the front, and then to the back through the shoulder-blades.
It then goes into the arms (maintaining then horizontally).

# Going Up

When going up, the **shoulders are going down**.
When going back to medium, elbows should not fall. They stay in line with the shoulders.
Feel the Gravity pushing the shoulder down.

Pay attention to not have a hollow back!

# Going Down

When going down, we have an **extension of the head**.
As if someone was pulling from the hair.

# In Dance

Focus on one of two (either going up or going down).
However do not stay only up (e.g. in extension) as this makes the dance stiff.

# Opposite

### Waltz

When going down, shoulder goes even lower.
When going up, heads extends even more.
On 2, slightly relax the shoulders.

It is the same movement as breathing with the shoulders (but very light).
Inhale on 2. Exhale on 3 and 1.

**To apply to other dances**

### Tango

In tango we don't have a swing, thus this movement is applied during Slow.
on Slow you *load* and on Quick you lower the shoulders.
