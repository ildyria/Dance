# Step

**Go down before stepping**
In contrary other dances which move the core before the rest,
in Tango we go lower first to prepare the step.

# Arms

Arms have to be horizontal. There is **NO SWAY**.
Pay attention, that while you might feel horizontal it probably is not be the case.
Use/Crunch the side/obliques in order to keep that straight.
