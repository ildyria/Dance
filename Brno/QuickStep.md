# Start posture

Pay attention to the angle of the right hip : slightly more forward.
Chest is facing the direction you want to take, not tilted to the left.

(before going one way, you have to go the other way)
Start on 8, not on 1 (after the preparation step)

# Pivots

While going backward, step slightly to the left (behind).
Do not turn directly, step then turn.

It is a swinging movement. Forward, backward, forward, backward...
