# General

Left arm should be (usually) higher than the right arm.
**Think about presenting the flag.**
**DO NOT RISE OR FALL** it will occur naturally with the ankles.

# Start posture

Pay attention to the angle of the right hip : slightly more forward.
Chest is facing the direction you want to take, not tilted to the left.

Preparation step, when stepping on left, add slight rotation to the left.
(before going one way, you have to go the other way)
Start on 8, not on 1 (after the preparation step)

# Pivots

While going backward, step slightly to the left (behind).
Do not turn directly, step then turn.

It is a swinging movement. Forward, backward, forward, backward...

# Turning lock

Rhythm in our case is QQSS (1&2 3).
Stay low.

**Do not turn during the lock**, turn after the lock!
Rise and fall is *High Low High Low* (High on left leg).

Go slightly under during & and go over during 2 3.

# Rise and fall

Knee should always be bent => try to stay low all the time.
**The rise will come from the ankle.**

# Running right turns

Start in promenade (cf next section).
RF S (step)
LF Q (closed)
RF Q (open, stepping slightly back)
LF S (**add rotation to the right to let partner pass**)
RF Q (closed, leg in the middle between partner's legs/going forward)
LF Q (open, to the right side of the partner)
Pay attention to rise and fall.

# Promenade

Before the promenade, contract the right side (*"Technical Sway"*).
Keep the arms horizontal, do not bent forward (left).
At the same time present the left side of the chest (flag/sponsor...)

# Head and movement

head should be in the back, jaw horizontally, this helps to put the weight on the back.
Imagine reaching forward/kicking before stepping.
