# Start  
  
Arms and body should form a cross.  
  
Feel two stripe of energy going from the heel of each foot to the forward of the body.  
When the energy passes, rise the arms.  
Energy continues over the shoulder and go down make sure the shoulder relax.  
Energy continues down in the back and spread the shoulder blades.  
  
# Connecting  
  
Before the connection, still be on the heel.  
Slowly go down and at the same time forward to the toe.  
The point is **not to bend the knees**, **but to go forward for the connection**.
