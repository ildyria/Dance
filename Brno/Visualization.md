# Picture what you want do

You should think about how you want to do.
What shape you want to give.
Where you want to place your partner.
What should be the form of your couple.
How should you place your space.

**MAKE SPACE FOR YOUR PARTNER**

Exercise:

Close your eyes and imagine what you want to do.
Silently (or on music), dance what you want 5 times.
Do not focus on the mistakes, focus on how your body feels.

# Picture what you want to represent.

You should picture something (swan, river, shape...)
that you want your dance to represent.

Same exercise as above but this time picturing the image rather than what you want to do.
