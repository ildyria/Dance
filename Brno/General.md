# Moving and Dancing  
  
**Dancing is moving.**  
If you don't move, you don't dance.  
Just technique is not dancing.  
Dancing is first about movement then technique.  
  
Dancing alone with the arms flowing as following the wind/a river/waves.  
If you stop moving, this means you are in a contradiction.  
  
# Moving and turning  
  
Imagine the spine of your partner: do not go through it. Go around it.  
However do not go around your partner.  
  
  
# Leading  
  
- It is done with the core.  
- **Before every move, the core move first to prepare the step and also to "tell"  
the lady about what is coming next.**  
  
# Other  
  
Picture in the mind what should be the lady position you want to achieve and lead her into it.  
  
# During warm-up  
  
Explore the limits of the foot with the weight (while also maintaining heel on the floor)
