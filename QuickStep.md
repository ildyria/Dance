# Random advises

- The quick-quick is *quick* and **light**.
- The slow steps are *slow*. Careful especially on the timing when going backward.
- **Do not drop, go lower slower**, kind of *pendulum* movement: it is a swing dance.

# Run

- Run on the front part of the foot. The heel should not touch the floor.
- Try to be as silent as possible.
- Outside steps in the run are bigger because you have more space.

# Rolly-Polly // Running Right Turn

- Sharper on the Quicks
- Head moves to Left to Neutral to Left again.
- Use a **pull movement when going back** (Slow LF in CBMP)
- Don't go lower, go longer, like pulling and turning.
- Keep the butt in and the Head high
- Keep the spine straight

# start
