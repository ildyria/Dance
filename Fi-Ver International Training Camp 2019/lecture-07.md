# Fi-Ver dance camp

* Slow Waltz

## Actions

There are 4 types of Actions:

1. Rotation
2. Sway
3. Displacement
4. Extension

### Rotation

- When rotating to the right you can go as far as you want.
- When rotating to the left, you can't go further than your left toe.
- Don't forget to also rotate with the hip or the lady cannot follow.

### Sway

When doing the sway (direction of a sway is the direction that goes down), you look in the direction of the sway.

During a sway to the left you lower in the knees otherwise the arms of the lady are too high and it is ugly.

### Displacement

Your head goes in the direction of the displacement.

### Extension

During the extension, you open the rib cage to give the pressure to the lady so she can extend.
**Because your shoulders go back during the extension, the hands needs to go up.**
Make sure you keep connection wrist-arm pit otherwise it is heavy for the lady.

## Timing

- In a natural turn, the first one is the rotation, the comes sway and displacement then comes extension.
- In a reverse turn, it is the same but the displacement is not here.
- It is not rotation then sway etc, but they need to blend to each other.
