# Fi-Ver dance camp

* Viennese Waltz

## Direction and acceleration

When going forward, accelerate on the first step.
The second step is also forward, only turn at the end when closing.

Look at a pendulum, when released it accelerate. We want the same picture.

## Energy

Only provide energy when going forward.

## Interaction with the lady

It is not Man - Lady - Man - Lady in term of energy.
The energy of the lady should be slightly lower than the energy of the man.
The role of the Lady is to provide volume and side sway.

However there is a time for the Man and a time for the Lady.

## Hand position

Don't forget to keep the connection at the wrist, it makes the dance lighter for the lady.
