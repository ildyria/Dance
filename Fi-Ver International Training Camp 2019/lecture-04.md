## Contrast

There are 4 ways to create contrast in Tango:

Weight |  High // Light // Soft  |  Low // Heavy // Strong
time   |      Quick              |       Slow
space  |      Flexible           |       Direct
Energy |      Free               |       Bound

As an exercise, pick one category and try to apply contrast, differentiate when are the one to the other.
