# Fi-Ver dance camp

* Slow-fox

It is not the man is leading, the lady is following but both are listening to each other.

## Shadow exercice

Partners place in front of each other, put some slow music.

1. The Man do a movement, the Lady must mirror the movement while still only looking the man in the eyes
2. idem but Lady is doing the movement
3. The man and the lady do movements and randomly each one take over.

## Movement

In dance, the core is moving in the direction of which the dancer wants to go. Use the weight. In case of going backward, invite the lady.
The core is not the only thing that moves, the head moves to. Think about walking or running, the head is going in front of the body.
The head must be active in dancing, inviting the movement.

The person at the outside of the circle is the person with the active head. Both head cannot be active at the same time (with exceptions, e.g. throwaway oversway)

**Fallaway:**  
Fallaway, the active head is the lady on 1 2 3 4 => slip pivot.  
Bounce Fallaway the active head is of the lady on 1 2 3 4 but on 4 the head of the man is also active, defining the direction of the dance.

**Tumble turn:**  
1. Man head is active.
2. Man head is active.
3. & Lady's head is active.  
4. Man head is active.

**Throwaway oversway:**
Man head is active first and the both are active.

**Promenade:**
Don't forget the lowering, the lady's head is active first and then the Man head is active to bring back the lady.

Using the head helps to create a bigger shape.
