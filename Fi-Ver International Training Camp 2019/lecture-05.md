* Quick-step

## The F-word

For Feet.

In Quickstep, the feet are always on the floor *aside from "stepping forward"*.

## Combination

basic step 	&rArr; forward lock 	&rArr; 123 of natural turn 	&rArr; back lock 	&rArr; tipple chasse to the right 	&rArr; forward lock & back to basic

## syncopated steps

You can do quick & quick during the locks or the tipple chasse.

During syncopated steps there is a bounce effect like a tennis ball on the floor.

## Rise and fall

The Rise and fall are less strong as in Waltz. By keeping the feet on the floor you lower that effect.

## Scatters

Should be silent. Use the ankles to absorb the movement.
