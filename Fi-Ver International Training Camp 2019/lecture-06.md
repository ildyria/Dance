## English Waltz

1. 1 is forward, 2 is high, 3 is low. **DO NOT LOWER ON 1 !!!**
2. Head position is 45 degree in normal time, 60 degree in promenade
3. position of the left arm is in line with the shoulder, the height of the left hand is at eye height of the lady
4. Use your body weight to prepare the step and *warn* the lady of the direction you want to go.
5. In promenade, pay attention to the position of the lady, don't be in front of her. When stepping forward make sure you don't cut the direction of the lady.

## Slowfox

Same thing that in English Waltz, use the body weight, make bigger steps.
In the Slowfox you don't go on toes, you stay on the ball of the foot.

**Give the lady space, the more space you give her, the happier she will be**  
*Let her go and she will come back*

## Throwaway oversway

During the Throwaway, your direction is 45 degree not straight forward. Because when you go oversway, you don't want to show your back.
