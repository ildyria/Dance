# Fi-Ver dance camp

* Slow Waltz

## Movement

During the movement the core move together. The person going forward is the motor.

Maintain a connection from the rib cage to the hips.

## Exercice 1

Without arms, in position, just do *close changes* going forward. Man leading.
Keep the connection.

## Exercice 2

Still without arms, in position, just do *close changes* going backward. Lady leading.
Keep the connection.

**Nota: When lowering and collecting, start to move forward/prepare your step.**

## Exercice 3

Idem but in frame.  

## Exercice 4

Apply this to choreography: first without arms to feel the connection and when who is the motor.
Then do with a light frame: arms are just a slight help, really use the connection to create movement.

# Movement

You never do a complete turn (without moving into a direction -- line of dance) because otherwise the movement stop.
