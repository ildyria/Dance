# Tango

### Emil steps:

- cbm in walks with curve to the left.
- link is more an action to the back, rotation of both hips, not just the right one.
- close the hips before the ronde
- during open reverse turn, bigger step first, follow Laura, give her space with the lowering of the hips

### short side
- Apply Emil parts
- Swivels: step back, hips in promenade :warning:
- Big Top: keep the head outside to the left, bigger step forward
- Mini 5 steps & link actions needs to be quicker and hips-top-head
- flicker in the foot for quickness, stay relaxed
- During Viennese crosses & fallaway, pivot around the left arm
- Change of direction: head stays outside to the left

In position: under-over. More "hugging" but head high, left side up but connected with the right hips.
