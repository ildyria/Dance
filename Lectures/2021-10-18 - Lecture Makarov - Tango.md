# Tango

- Key point: communication in the couple. Not doing more complex steps, but making it a great conversation in the dance that is visible to the audience.
- Leading the lady by blocking her way or going around her: lead by going to the right spot yourself. In closed promenade to fallaway the lady is blocking 
- Something with a spotlight; don't pull or push the lady into it. She will follow your body: example where they just walk without being physically connected. The arms are just assistance.... 
- choreo: walk walk promenade back close. walk walk rock slow back side close. The aim of this simple choreo was to make something of nothing.
- Focus the head/attention. E.g. When you are going around the lady in the slow of the wiggle steps into close, this first slow (Whaaaah), you spot and focus (e.g. to the audience, and you will see a smile, you can even smile youself nice nice), and then in the quicks the lady follows and goes around you (pada pa), and follows your spot/head. It is a really nice way to connect to the audience and your partner.
