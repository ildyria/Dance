Laura should not do head rolls in throwaway oversway
Benoît should relax shoulders

# English Waltz

### Throwaway oversway

- B. do not step top big in the promenade: rather, focus on bringing the head weight to the left foot, and then lower and rotate.
- L: focus on stretching the leg and keep the left side to B.

### P.P. after T.O.

- Close the feet for proper weight transfer
- B. Keep left side up

### Lockstep into reverse toe pivot

- direction is diagonal into corner
- Lower into the left hip (penguin) on 3 to go to lunge 
- movement is similar to open natural into tipple chassé 

### Lunge

- B. big top on left on 1
- Go over the lady

### Slip pivot

### Chasse

### Back Check
- B. Slip pivot stay on the stand leg with head, don't use the head weight.
