# English Waltz

- Technical sway comes from the knees

### exercise

stand on one leg, go in the knee, hip "out". Don't cross and do the arme exercise. Then, go stand neutral again and put hip up to make sway also. It felt like he did way less than I did, it was really light and into his own body and balance.

### exercise

in the knee, to the side, collect and hip up, in the knee... repeat.

### attention points

= don't extend the leg already. Fall into the stap, only let the leg go when you go. Reaaaally push (he blew me away with one step :'D) and actively collect. 
- both the head and the hip move to the side, but the hip moves quicker, so the sway changes.

### Roles

- who does more sway/hip when? Outer circle does more hip. Be aware of it. If both do too much sway you will dance smaller.

### 3 functions of sway

1. change direction
2. to get around each other more easily
3. to control speed
