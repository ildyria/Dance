### Seatbelts/cross body connection
- Laura: top is not connected to hips, make sure that it i connected even when you rotate.
- put a belt around the hips, it should always be tilted
- Laura: put the high hip up more extremely for now
- knee above foot or even inwards if it helps
- balls up and make sure to do a proper drive step
- swing is a natural consequence of tilting the hips; 
- use more the hips (swing)

### Feather step
- Laura: the hip is low on the left and high on the right. You keep it that way also in the quick steps

### Fallaway
- Benoît: delay the rotation
- keep straight, don't put the hips back

### Tumble turn
- head active on 1, passive on 234
- let Laura turn me, Laura active
- curves on first step

### Throwaway oversway
- close your eyes and follow the jedi
- flat, ball in the turning, flat
- feet hip wide
- stretch extending leg so well that your bum hurts while extending
- Laura: go as low as Benoît goes
- Benoît: go lower to help Laura
- Keep left side up

### Natural telemark:
- go through the hips to create the right sway
- 4: hips tilt back, right hips slightly forward
- keep the point of lightness above the hips.

### Rondé:
- it is a consequence of an action/indication from the hip of the lead
