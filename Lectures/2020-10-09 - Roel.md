# Tango

- after a syncopeded chassé, step on a toe
- in the fallaway-whisk, lock when the weight is already on the right leg.
- in the fallaway-whisk, do not drop the left side.
- in the fallaway-whisk, rotate the body
- in Viennese crosses, the action is only from the hips and the head but not from the top. Keep the left side to the lady, do not actively rotate.

# Slow Foxtrot
- Use the glutes to move forward. This will prevent from having the top hanging back and thus lifting the foot.
- pay attention to the speed of the legs, they should stay connected to the body.

# English Waltz
- Roll in natural spinturn.
- Rolverdeling man/lady. 
- Don't pull away left side
- step direction of tipple chassé thingy
- Head to the left/follow the sway

# Viennese Waltz 
- use the Glutes! 
- hips over feet
