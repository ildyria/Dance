# Quick step

- More difference between quick and slows
- at the end, it is now SS SS instead of Q&QS SS.
- we can choose if we want to do the 1st one slow and the 2nd one action, or both actions.
- L: stay left.

# Slowfox

- light bounce in the 1 of the bounce fallaway, go over the lady, nearly wing position for 1 2.
- Throwaway: 
  - The promenade can be a bit shorter so that the trowaway has more time. Make it a smooth movement.
  - B: stay with the lady, don't step too big : step under your head and the go over the lady. First lower, then rotate.
  - L: keep the sides up and stretchg the leg.


# Tango

The first part of the first short side (until and including fallaway) is staccato compared to legato in the second part. Mini 5 step is staccato.

Keep the head up.
