# Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Lowering and control

Uses 123 Waltz tempo

* Chasse (1 2&3) - Collect (456) - Step (1)
* backward -> Chasse - Collect - Step

Freeze on the 3 of the chasse and then collect.
Pay attention to the weight transfer on the collect part:

- 1 of collect is ON the foot.
- 2 of collect is IN the foot.
- 3 of collect is INTO of the foot (move body-weight to the front of the foot by moving the knee forward).

Do not think where you go but where you come from.

Use CBM in the 456-collect to give space to the lady.

## Exercise 2 - Lowering and control

* Chasse to the right 1 2&3
* into promenade

Think about:

- Use the ankle & hips to lead - open the lady.
- Use CBM (but don't lead with the top) to give space.

Do not block the lady movement when going from the chasse to promenade.

Nota: Tempo of the chasse can be 1&2 3. Absorb the movement on 2 for more effect.
