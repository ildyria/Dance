# Posture

The body is divided in 4 parts:
- knees
- hips & center of gravity
- rib cage & top & point of lightness
- head

When moving, knees & point of lights go forward, center of gravity goes back, head stays in the middle

During the resist part of the drive action, this gives an elastic band effect.

This also results in standing more straight.
