# English Waltz

### 123 Natural turn

While lowering, go into the foot, and down forward, extend the right foot & control.
- When stepping on right, push with the left foot.
Try to go as big as possible, especially during practice.
- Use the foot entirely, from 5 (heel) to 1 (toe)
- remember, rotation comes from the knees, then the hips, then the top.
- when pushing with left foot,  use the rolling action.
- When left leg goes forward, deep in the hips, "swing the hips to the left" for the reach. However don't leave the body behind while extending the leg".

### 456 - Spin turn

Wait for the lady on 4, push + rolling action on 5, wait for lady on 6.

# :warning: Slowfox

- Do not rise and fall.
- Use the full foot

### Feather step

- Rise only comes from the ankles.
- The last step (outside edge of toe) is not big.
- Moving comes from the core, the point of lightness and the center of gravity must be on a vertical line.

### Tumble turn

The pivoting action is not big because you also need to let the lady pass.

### Pivot after Throwaway Oversway

Change weight on 4, step more outside before the pivots.
