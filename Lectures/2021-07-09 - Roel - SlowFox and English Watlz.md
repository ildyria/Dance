# Formation

- Checked formation EW and SF and it was okay. L. step more around B. first step of SF.
- Showed what we learned in slowfox with Claudia:

---------------

# Slow ðŸ¦Š

The cross connection is not just forward, it's also in the back. Otherwise, the shoulder drop in front.

### Position

Think about torso forward and slightly down to extend the back. The idea is to be straight. The Jaw line slightly higher.

### Feather Step

Move with the center and the knees. Don't hang back.

### Tumble turn

Free the head.

### Run

Look *right* don't just tilt the head.

### Top spin

Lower once 4th step is landed.

# English Waltz

Similar to SlowFox: free the head.

### lock step

You can look to the right over the Lady.

### lunge

Don't go head first then torso then head. Doesn't make sense.
