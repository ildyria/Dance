# Formation

## Slowfox

**improve dance quality.**
1. Ankle rise and body rise. No knees. Hips rise minimally. It is not EW
2. Feet don't leave the floor.
3. Feather step three step footwork: mind the inside edge of toe etc.
4. Correct rotation of the body, which comes from the knees and hips.
5. Let the lady dance: give her the opportunity to move and rotate on the points that she should be active.
6. Let the man dance: build on his movements for extensions and head actions, more smooth and fluent. Let him move and rotate on the points where he should be active.

## Rotations

**the left side determines the amount of rotation.**
### Natural turns 
- Forward you move with the legs and rotate with the top.
- Backward you follow, roll the feet, and support the rotation.

## Reverse turns
- Forward you rotate the left side, with which you have the inside turn. You are the movement motor with the feet.
- Backward you have the outside turn when it comes to rotation, but you are not the motor with the feet.

## Exercises
Basic EW choreo. Or just going one way with the rotations. SF little less rotation but same principle.
