## Foot Technique

1. Don't swing whit the arms. Just **FOLLOW the hips**
2. Don't sway with the hips (don't force it)
3. Lowest point is on 1. Continue to rise on 2, 3.  
The full beat of 3 is used as control (descending).  
Use the ankles more than the knees.

## Remarks

- By following the hips you give more space to the lady.
- Move the hups forward towards the parner. /!\ This is not a "butt lift"
- keep the back and head straight over your toes.  
=> move with your center.

**Focus on the hips, not the sway**
