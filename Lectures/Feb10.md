In tango the connection on the Right arm is not at the wrist but in the middle of the forearm

# Slow-fox

### Frame

There are 4 octopuses in the back.
- Two on the left, two on the right.
- One on each shoulder blade. One on each hips.

The one on the top left always try to go up.  
The one on the top right tries to go up with the lady.  
The one on the bottom right always tries to go with the lady.

Everything over the ribcage is fixed and should move as a block.
The arms are working together with the upper body.

Stay straight and **keep the head up.**

### Preparation step

When stepping to the left, still give the right side to the lady. Idem when going to the right.   
<- 1234  
-> 567  
<- 8  

### Counting

Counting is twice quicker.

### Fallaway

**There are 4 steps, so it is 1 2 3 4**!

Pay attention with the arms. If you extend the left arm too much to the front,
you are forcing the lady out of position.

### Tumble turn

- 1 - low
- 2 - low
- 3 - high
- 3& - high
- 4 - Ribcage is still high. **DO NOT GO DOWN.**

### Moving

When moving you must get the feeling you are on a hoverboard. You glide on the floor.
There is no shocks, stops... Just a smooth movement.

#### Going backward

- Do not forget to extend when going back.
- Just be lazy and let the heel slide on the floor.
- Each feet is on its track a bit like cross-country skiing, the legs are not closed.
- One bar is inside partner, one bar is outside partner. Do not forget to give room for the partner to step inside.
