# Tango

Power and quickness in the tango comes from the hips / lower core.
Emil  would get punched in the bladder when he did it wrong.

Lead with the core, not with the top. Keep the space for the space for the lady intact.

Impulse comes from the lower core/hips. 

The only difference between tango and other BR dances is from the knee down.
