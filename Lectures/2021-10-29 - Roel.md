# Topics: selling, connection, roleS

We are not selling. We need to show more conviction that our ford fiesta is a lamborghini.

# Slowfox:
- Laura stay more UP think up!
- Roles: do less for Benoît, mostly, and more for Laura
- Staying to the left for Laura
- Using both feet while dancing for Laura, especially in forward steps keep rolling both feet and use hips for sway in the featherstep.
- Stay low in top spin figure for Benoît
- keep lines up, use the hips (lecture Madis) and not break the top 
- in feather finish don't dance frontal for Benoît


# Quickstep:
- Running right turn footwork: forward, sideways, backward; backward, sideways, forward.
- Roles in quick open reverse.
