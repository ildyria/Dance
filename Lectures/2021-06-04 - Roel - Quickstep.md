# Quickstep

- wind up and directly start on 1 with right foot.
- Make the quick quicker and the slow shower.
- Travel + kick lower on the Ninja kicks
- in the line, don't look at the floor look at the horizon
- the steps are similar to a hover (except step inside) => more emphasis on the hips to let the lady pass.
- go back to neutral before the outside change
- Cadenzato = stay low. Don't try to go high in the slows. The difference is already there.
- knees then hips then top then head. *delay the top*

- Rolverdeling!!! Do LESS when it is not your turn
- start playing more with the swing in swing dance
- practise spinturn into something hipsy to emphasize on the movement from feet upward
