# English Waltz

### Set up

Don't shift the hips outward to the right.

### Turning lock

On 3 go on the foot and lead as in a Hover (but the other way)

### lunge, back check

Extend the head to follow the movement

### Double lock

Don't over turn, top direction in the ending is diagonal to wall, not in line of dance

### open natural

Use the hips more before the top.

### chass√©

Point the foot as if on a lunge.

### outside change

Don't step to far, L. still has to pass.

*Soft ankles on 3*
Continue the movement with the head. Don't initiate with the head: knees, hips, top, head.
