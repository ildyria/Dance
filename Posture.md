## Mise en place  
  
1. Feet closed. Straight.  
2. Lean slightly forward to shit the weight on the front part of your feet.  
3. Bend you knees slightly so they are above the boll of your feet.  
4. Push the pelvis forward and the tail bone to the floor (rotation/pivot).  
5. Contract the core toward the **INSIDE**    
   Core is not just the upper part bellow the plexus but also the part above the pelvis.    
   Contracting it give the same feeling of doing crunches.    
6. Lower part of the Rib cage should be down    
   Feel connection between the hips and the bottom of the Rib cage  
7. Upper part of the Rib cage should be up  
8. Extend the neck toward the top, head slightly turned to the left.  
9. **Spine has to be Straight**. A vertical line should pass through:  
    - front of foot  
    - knees  
    - mid hips/pelvis  
    - mid rib cage  
    - shoulders  
    - head  
10. Relax the shoulders and arms.  
11. Bring arms to *Second position*  
12. Extend to the elbows and arms to the side.  
13. Open arms and position.  
14. **Keep the upper back flat**  
  
15. Invite partner to take position:  
    - **Look at her, acknowledge**.  
    - Bring Left hand slightly forward to invite.  
    - Place Right hand near the shoulder-blade/bra  
    - Provide Upward pressure with the right wrist under the shoulder.  
    - Bring partner into the frame **WITHOUT PULLING BACKWARD OR TWISTING**  
    - Bring left arm slightly backward in line with Right arm.  
    - Go lower and make connection at the knees and under the rib cage.  
    - Chest has to stay in place and not twist, idem for the hips.  
    - **CHECK if hips are correctly placed: straight/slightly inward partner**  
16. Place left front arm at a 45 degree angle. (unless Tango?)  
  
Do not forget to give place to partner especially with the right arm.  
  
In the end, the back should be flat. Shoulder blades should not point out.  
Do not bring the arms back, it uses unnecessary forces.  
  
The core should be contracted but the upper part (chest) should be relaxed (but still holding and provide tension).  
  
**Bonus point:** Give expression!  
  
## Head position  
  
It is **not** *"look, there is a bird"*.    
Look 45 degrees (about 10:30 o' clock)  
Head should be held high.  
  
  
## Feeling  
  
1. Lie down on the floor.  
2. Knees slightly bent.  
3. Engage the core.    
    Crunch feeling as seen above.  
4. **Spine should be straight and always touch the floor**.  
5. Extend horizontally.  
6. Feel the the straight & flat feeling.
